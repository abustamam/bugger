# Bugger

This is a game created for the Frontend Nanodegree project #3. 

## How to play

The easiest way to play is by going to the pushed [website](http://abustamam.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/). 

If you'd like to make changes to the game (for example, adding your own levels), download the repo and use something like SimpleHTTPServer on Python.

Simply type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and it should work. Please refer to the documentation for other assistance with setting up a server.
